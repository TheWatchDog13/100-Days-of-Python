# Day 3 – Python Conditionals Practice

Today's focus was on learning and applying conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. This folder contains three small projects that demonstrate how control flow works in Python:

📁 Projects Included

- **🍕 pizza_billing.py**  
  Calculates the final cost of a pizza order based on size and selected toppings (pepperoni, extra cheese).

- **🎢 rollercoaster_ticket.py**  
  Determines ticket pricing based on height and age, with optional photo add-on.

- **🏴‍☠️ treasure_island.py**  
  A simple text-based adventure game where the player navigates through choices to find a hidden treasure.

Each script can be run independently with:

```bash
python filename.py
