# Day 2 - Tip Calculator ðŸ’¸

This is the second project from my **100 Days of Python** challenge.  
Itâ€™s a simple **Tip Calculator** that helps you split a restaurant bill and add a tip.

## ðŸ§® What it Does

- Asks for the total bill
- Asks how much tip to give (e.g. 10%, 12%, 15%)
- Splits the bill evenly between a number of people
- Outputs how much each person should pay

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to take user input with `input()`
- Converting input strings to floats and ints
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Using `round()` to format decimals
- String interpolation (f-strings)

## ðŸš€ How to Run It

```bash
python tip_calculator.py
