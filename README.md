# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Daily Project Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! This is part of a self-imposed challenge to sharpen my Python skills by building and documenting one project per day for 100 days — no matter how simple or advanced.

Each day, I create a small Python script or application, organize the code into its own folder, and write up what I built and what I learned. Projects range from beginner-friendly tools (like calculators, name generators, and basic games) to intermediate challenges involving logic, file I/O, APIs, and more.

---

## 🔥 Challenge Goals
- Build a public, well-documented portfolio of Python projects
- Strengthen core Python skills through daily practice
- Develop consistent habits around coding, documentation, and version control
- Share my journey to help and inspire other learners

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- VS Code / PyCharm
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Markdown for documentation

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each day/project is organized like this:

Day001_BandNameGenerator/
├── main.py
└── README.md
